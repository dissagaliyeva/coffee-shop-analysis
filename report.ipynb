    "Coffee has become an integral part of our everyday lives. We start the day with it, have one with friends/colleagues over a break, and even go on coffee dates. It's not surprising that almost any establishment has a variety available 24/7. Why is it so? \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is pretty simple - it brings a lot of money. To illustrate the impact of coffee on our daily life, let's look at some numbers. In 2020/2021 the total coffee consumption worldwide had been estimated to be 166.63 million 60kg bags [1]. Moreover, within five years, the market is estimated to bring $201.4 billion [2]. It makes sense why coffee stands are popping up on every corner, doesn't it? \n",

    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis was conducted to understand the current coffee market in Ukraine. This information would then be used to create marketing plans to expand the businesses. To understand the market, we were supplemented with a dataset consisting of 200 entries that were evenly spread across 10 regions. It's also important to mention that, even though there are ten cities, the number of unique regions is nine. There are two cities, Khrivoy Rog and Dnipro, that represent the same Dnipropetrovsk region. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook discusses the methods that were used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature and model selection. Since the end-goal was to find the segments, there was a need to select an appropriate unsupervised algorithms. The dataset had more categorical values than numeric, there were two algorithms implemented: K-Means and K-Prototype.\n",

    "#### Deliver, Dine-in, and Takeout options columns\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, the dataset had a bad missing value condition; the number of rows with at least one missing value made up **60.5%**. The most compromised columns were *price, delivery, dine-in, and takeout* options:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data/img/dist.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The side-by-side barplots show that the last two columns have only one recurring value. This raises a question, \"Can we simply impute the rest of the data entries with False?\". The answer is no. There are two main reasons for that:\n",
    "- It can introduce the venues that don't provide any services: no delivery, no dine-in and takeout options. This would be a pretty useless business, wouldn't it? \n",
    "- There is a pattern for the missing values! \n",
    "\n",
    "A closer look into the place types showed that there was a mixture of cafes, stores, e-shops, and coffe-places. This means that such places as e-shops and repair shops introduced the necessity to include \"takeout\" column (other places are required to have such an option). After careful consideration, I have narrowed down the imputation process into the following steps:\n",
    " \n",
    "- Cafes and restaurants **must** have both dine-in and takeout options\n",
    "- E-shops and appliance/convenience/service stores **cannot** have any of the options because they can sell a lot of other things at the same time. Here we have two options: drop the values or put them onto the same category \"Other\". \n",
    "- All places **except** for e-shops and service shops should have a takeout option \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Price column\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Price\" column had 78 missing values. Looking at its distribution showed that the vast majority of the places had a moderate price tag. The figure below shows the current price distribution. It was safe to assume that prices are generally not that high, so the imputation method for this column was to choosing the most common value (mode). \n",

    "#### Reviews & Ratings \n",
    "\n",
    "These two columns were treated using grouping by \"Place Type\" and \"Region\" columns. Choosing such a method was, in my opinion, a more logical choice than a simple mean imputation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "There was only a single data entry that different most: a coffee shop that had almost 18,000 reviews. The rest of the places had around 500 reviews on average. The best solution was to drop the data entry."

    "- **What's the most common shop in each region?** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"q1\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the overall number of places, coffee shops are on the lead (98 out of 199). They are almost twice the number of the second most common place - cafes (58 out of 199). This can lead to believe that the trends are going to be the same across the country, right? Well, it's almost true. 8 out of 10 regions have the same trend - each of them have a bigger number of **coffee shops**. The two regions that didn't make the list were Dnipro and Khrivoy Rog. It's interesting because both cities represent the same county/oblast! It's more common to have cafes for them.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Do trends differ depending on the city's size?** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"q2\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The divisions indeed revealed some important insights. For starters, both metropolis and counties have more coffee shops, whereas cities prefer cafes where they can sit and relax. Next, as anticipated, bigger cities provide richer variety. Here we can see that there is a pretty big number of Espresso bars. Moreover, coffee stands were absent in the biggest cities. This statement will definitely need to addressed in the future. In our case, with only 200 data points, it's hard to make any assumptions.\n",

    "It's a good question to ask about their differences. Both accomplish the same task to find clusters based on data similarity. The difference lies in their instantiations. K-Means tolerates only numeric values. It cannot work with categories. Since our dataset is highly categorical, it would be a waste of data not to include them. K-Prototype address the exact issue, it takes both categorical and numeric values to make decisions. \n"

    "**Interpretation**: There are three main segments the business market can be divided into. The first group represents shops that don't have a delivery option. Those are the places where people come to relax and feel like at home. Maybe they're the ones where we can go for our next coffee-dates? These places have an OK rating and reviews, and they make up the majority of our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second cluster represent places with the best service based on their reviews. Even though there's not a big number of reviews, they're know how to serve customers. The only problem is that there was a big number of missing values in delivery option. Therefore, it's hard to say what other options the businesses provide. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last cluster represents a busy lifestyle of the people in big cities. We need our coffe, and we need it now! This cluster has all the services available. It's not surprising that they have the biggest number of reviews, huh? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### K-Prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "This method suggested diving the data into 2 clusters:\n",

    "| Group | Rating | Review | Delivery | Dine-in & Takeout | # of shops |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 0 | Low-High | High (avg=1242) | Yes | Yes | 63 |\n",
    "| 1 | Medium-High (4.3-5) | Low (avg=203) | False | Yes | 136 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, both K-Means and K-Prototypes suggest taking shops with and without delivery options. The model implies that there's a big distinction between these group. It's true and it was found during the Exploratory Data Analysis step in [Question 3](#q3). "
